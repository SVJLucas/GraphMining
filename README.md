# Large Scale Graph Mining

## Overview
The proliferation of complex networked data across diverse domains such as biology, social networks, economics, and communication systems has challenged conventional data analysis methods. This complexity, characterized by intricate connections and dynamic interactions among network components, necessitates the development of new analytical frameworks. Enter network science, an interdisciplinary field that leverages mathematical, computational, and social science theories to understand and analyze these complex structures. It focuses on creating algorithms and models that can map network topologies, assess node influence, and interpret the evolution of these networks over time, thus providing insights into the fundamental processes shaping these interconnected systems.

Central to network science is the exploration of centrality measures, random walks, PageRank algorithms, and the application of machine learning techniques like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for advanced network analysis. These tools are instrumental in identifying key nodes, predicting network behaviors, and uncovering community structures within networks. Moreover, network science addresses critical problems such as community detection and influence maximisation, aiming to delineate natural groupings within networks and optimize the spread of information. As networked systems become increasingly integral to various aspects of life and technology, the contributions of network science are invaluable for deciphering and leveraging the complexities of these vast data landscapes.
